Introduction
============

Developer Publications is creating a new book called *The Swift Programming Language*, to help with the adoption of Swift. A first edition of the complete book will be made available at WWDC 2014. Until then, it is a living document, and will be updated as the language evolves. The latest work-in-progress version is accessible from the chapter links below.
