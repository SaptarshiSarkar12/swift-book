Strings and Characters
======================

A :newTerm:`string` is an ordered collection of characters,
such as ``"hello, world"`` or ``"albatross"``.
Swift strings are represented by the ``String`` type,
which in turn represents a collection of ``Character`` values.

Strings
-------

.. write-me::

.. note::

   Swift's ``String`` type is bridged seamlessly to Objective-C's ``NSString`` class.
   If you are working with the Foundation framework in Cocoa or Cocoa Touch,
   the entire ``NSString`` API is available to call on any ``String`` value you create,
   in addition to the ``String`` features described in this chapter.
   You can also use a ``String`` value with any API that requires an ``NSString`` instance.
   
   For more information about using ``String`` with Foundation and Cocoa,
   see *Building Cocoa Apps With Swift*.

.. TODO: make this be a link to BCAWS.

.. QUESTION: This chapter is the only time I talk in detail about bridging in the Guide.
   Is this okay to do?

String Literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can include fixed ``String`` values within your code as :newTerm:`string literals`.
A string literal is a fixed sequence of textual characters
surrounded by a pair of double quotes (``""``),
and can be used to provide an initial value for a constant or variable:

.. testcode:: stringLiterals

   -> let someString = "Some string literal value"
   << // someString : String = "Some string literal value"

Note that Swift infers a type of ``String`` for the ``someString`` constant,
because it is initialized with a string literal value.

Special Characters in String Literals
_____________________________________

String literals can include the following special characters:

* The escaped special characters ``\0`` (null character), ``\\`` (backslash),
  ``\t`` (horizontal tab), ``\n`` (line feed), ``\r`` (carriage return),
  ``\"`` (double quote) and ``\'`` (single quote)
* Two-byte Unicode code points, written as ``\xnn``,
  where ``nn`` is two hexadecimal digits
* Four-byte Unicode code points, written as ``\unnnn``,
  where ``nnnn`` is four hexadecimal digits
* Eight-byte Unicode code points, written as ``\Unnnnnnnn``,
  where ``nnnnnnnn`` is eight hexadecimal digits

.. testcode:: specialCharacters

   -> let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
   << // wiseWords : String = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
   >> println(wiseWords)
   </ "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
   -> let dollarSign = "\x24"        // $,  Unicode code point U+0024
   << // dollarSign : String = "$"
   -> let blackHeart = "\u2665"      // ‚ô•,  Unicode code point U+2665
   << // blackHeart : String = "‚ô•"
   -> let swiftHeart = "\U0001F496"  // üíñ, Unicode code point U+1F496
   << // swiftHeart : String = "üíñ"

.. what about SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW?

   U+FE0F is the unicode variation selector.

Initializing an Empty String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to create an empty ``String`` value as the starting point
for building a longer string,
you can do so by assigning an empty string literal to a variable,
or by initializing a new ``String`` with initialization syntax:

.. testcode:: emptyStrings

   -> var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
   << // emptyString : String = ""
   -> var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initialization syntax
   << // anotherEmptyString : String = ""
   // these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other

.. QUESTION: I've made both of these variables,
   because you'd be likely to use them as such if they start out empty.
   Is this the correct approach to take here?

String Mutability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Objective-C and Cocoa,
you choose between two classes (``NSString`` and ``NSMutableString``)
to determine whether a string is allowed to be modified (or *mutated*).
Swift does not have this distinction.
Instead, you indicate whether a particular ``String`` can be modified
by assigning it to a variable (in which case it can be modified),
or to a constant (in which case it cannot be modified):

.. testcode:: stringMutability

   -> var variableString = "Mary had"
   << // variableString : String = "Mary had"
   -> variableString += " a little lamb"
   /> variableString is now \"\(variableString)\"
   </ variableString is now "Mary had a little lamb"
   ---
   -> let constantString = "its fleece was"
   << // constantString : String = "its fleece was"
   -> constantString += " white as snow"
   !! <REPL Input>:1:16: error: expression does not type-check
   !! constantString += " white as snow"
   !! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   // this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified

Strings are Value Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swift's ``String`` type is a *value type*.
This means that if you create a new ``String`` value,
that ``String`` value is *copied* when it is passed to a function or method,
or when it is assigned to a constant or variable.
In each case, a new copy of the existing ``String`` value is created,
and the new copy is passed or assigned, rather than the original version.
(Value types are described in :ref:`ClassesAndStructures_ValueTypesAndReferenceTypes`.)

.. note::

   This behavior is different to ``NSString`` in Cocoa.
   When you create an ``NSString`` instance in Cocoa,
   and pass it to a function or method or assign it to a variable,
   you are always passing or assigning a *reference* to the same single ``NSString``.
   No copying of the string takes place, unless you specifically request it.

Swift's copy-by-default ``String`` behavior
matches the way that strings are used in code in practice.
When a function or method passes you a ``String`` value,
it is clear that you own that exact ``String`` value,
regardless of where it came from.
You can be confident that the string you are passed will not be modified
unless you modify it yourself.

Behind the scenes, Swift's compiler optimizes string usage
so that actual copying only takes place when absolutely necessary.
This ensures that you always get great performance
when working with strings as value types within your code.

.. TODO: talk about what this means for bridging to NSString,
   and how the semantics for working with NSString
   relate to the default value semantics used by String.

Characters
----------

Individual characters are represented in Swift by the ``Character`` type.
You can access the individual ``Character`` values in a string
by iterating over that string with a ``for``-``in`` loop:

.. testcode:: characters

   -> for character in "Dog!üê∂" {
         println(character)
      }
   </ D
   </ o
   </ g
   </ !
   </ üê∂

The ``for``-``in`` loop is described in :ref:`ControlFlow_ForLoops`.

You can initialize a stand-alone ``Character`` constant or variable
from a single-character string literal
by providing a ``Character`` type annotation when you define the constant or variable:

.. testcode:: characters

   -> let interrobang: Character = "‚ÄΩ"

How Characters Are Represented in Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Character`` elements retrieved from Swift's ``String`` type
represent Unicode characters.
This is different from the characters in a Cocoa ``NSString``,
which are returned as individual UTF-16 code units
when accessed with the ``characterAtIndex`` method from ``NSString``.

This means that a Unicode emoji character such as üê•
(known as ``FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK``, or Unicode code point ``U+1F425``)
is considered to be a single character in Swift,
but is considered to be two characters when stored in an ``NSString`` in Objective-C.
This is because a ``FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK`` takes up two code units
when stored in UTF-16 format (where it is represented as ``U+D83D U+DC25``).

However, if you use an ``NSString`` as a ``String`` value in Swift,
that ``NSString`` will be treated just like a native ``Swift`` string,
and its  ``Character`` values will be true Unicode characters,
not UTF-16 code units.

For more information about Swift's Unicode support,
see :ref:`Strings_UnicodeRepresentations` below.

String and Character Concatenation
----------------------------------

``String`` and ``Character`` values can be concatenated with the addition operator (``+``)
to create a new ``String`` value:

.. testcode:: emptyStrings

   -> let string1 = "hello"
   << // string1 : String = "hello"
   -> let string2 = " there"
   << // string2 : String = " there"
   -> let character1: Character = "!"
   << // character1 : Character = <unprintable value>
   -> let character2: Character = "?"
   << // character2 : Character = <unprintable value>
   ---
   -> let stringPlusCharacter = string1 + character1        // equals "hello!"
   << // stringPlusCharacter : String = "hello!"
   -> let stringPlusString = string1 + string2              // equals "hello there"
   << // stringPlusString : String = "hello there"
   -> let characterPlusString = character1 + string1        // equals "!hello"
   << // characterPlusString : String = "!hello"
   -> let characterPlusCharacter = character1 + character2  // equals "!?"
   << // characterPlusCharacter : String = "!?"

You can also append a ``String`` or ``Character`` onto
an existing ``String`` variable with the addition assignment operator (``+=``):

.. testcode:: emptyStrings

   -> var instruction = "look over"
   << // instruction : String = "look over"
   -> instruction += string2
   /> instruction now equals \"\(instruction)\"
   </ instruction now equals "look over there"
   ---
   -> var welcome = "good morning"
   << // welcome : String = "good morning"
   -> welcome += character1
   /> welcome now equals \"\(welcome)\"
   </ welcome now equals "good morning!"

.. note::

   You can't append a ``String`` or ``Character`` onto an existing ``Character`` variable,
   because a ``Character`` value can only ever be one character long.

String Interpolation
--------------------

String interpolation enables you to construct a new ``String`` value
from constants, variables, literals, and expressions
by including their values inside a string literal.
Each item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped by a pair of parentheses,
prefixed by a backslash:

.. testcode:: stringInterpolation

   -> let multiplier = 3
   << // multiplier : Int = 3
   -> let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
   << // message : String = "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"
   /> message is \"\(message)\"
   </ message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"

In the example above,
the value of ``multiplier`` is inserted into a string literal as ``\(multiplier)``.
The actual value of ``multiplier`` is inserted into the string in place of this placeholder.

The value of ``multiplier`` is also used as part of a larger expression later in the string.
This expression calculates the value of ``Double(multiplier) * 2.5``,
and inserts the result (``7.5``) into the string.
In this case, the expression is written as ``\(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)``
when it is included inside the string literal.

.. note::

   The expressions you write inside parentheses within an interpolated string
   cannot contain an unescaped double quote (``"``) or backslash (``\``),
   and cannot contain a carriage return (``\r``) or line feed (``\n``).

String Initializers for Interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any value that you use with string interpolation must be of a type that can be used
to initialize a new ``String`` instance.
In the example above, the first interpolated value (``multiplier``) is an ``Int``,
and the second interpolated value (``Double(multiplier) * 2.5``) equates to a ``Double``.
Both of these types can be used to construct a ``String`` value,
and so the interpolation is valid.

.. note::

   If you want to make your own custom types available for use with string interpolation,
   you can extend ``String`` to give it a new initializer that takes
   an instance of your custom type. This process is described in :doc:`Extensions`.

.. _Strings_UnicodeRepresentations:

Unicode Representations
-----------------------

Swift provides four different ways to decompose a ``String`` value into smaller units.
As mentioned above, you can iterate over the string itself with a ``for``-``in`` statement
to access its individual ``Character`` values as Unicode characters.

Alternatively, you can access a ``String`` value
in one of three Unicode-compliant representations:

* A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the ``utf8`` property)
* A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the ``utf16`` property)
* A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values (accessed with the ``unicodeScalars`` property)

Each of the three examples below shows a different representation of the following string,
which is made up of the characters ``D``, ``o``, ``g``, ``!``,
and the üê∂ character (``DOG FACE``, or Unicode code point ``U+1F436``):

.. testcode:: unicodeRepresentations

   -> let dogString = "Dog!üê∂"

UTF-8
~~~~~

You can access a UTF-8 representation of a ``String``
by iterating over its ``utf8`` property.
This property is of type ``UTF8View``,
which is a collection of unsigned 8-bit (``UInt8``) values,
one for each byte in the string's UTF-8 representation:

.. testcode:: unicodeRepresentations

   -> for codeUnit in dogString.utf8 {
         print("\(codeUnit) ")
      }
   -> print("\n")
   </ 68 111 103 33 240 159 144 182

In the example above, the first four decimal ``codeUnit`` values
(``68``, ``111``, ``103``, ``33``)
represent the characters ``D``, ``o``, ``g``, and ``!``,
whose UTF-8 representation is the same as their ASCII representation.
The second four ``codeUnit`` values (``240``, ``159``, ``144``, ``182``)
are a four-byte UTF-8 representation of the üê∂ character.

UTF-16
~~~~~~

You can access a UTF-16 representation of a ``String``
by iterating over its ``utf16`` property.
This property is of type ``UTF16View``,
which is a collection of unsigned 16-bit (``UInt16``) values,
one for each 16-bit code unit in the string's UTF-16 representation:

.. testcode:: unicodeRepresentations

   -> for codeUnit in dogString.utf16 {
         print("\(codeUnit) ")
      }
   -> print("\n")
   </ 68 111 103 33 55357 56374

Again, the first four ``codeUnit`` values
(``68``, ``111``, ``103``, ``33``)
represent the characters ``D``, ``o``, ``g``, and ``!``,
whose UTF-16 code units have the same values as in the string's UTF-8 representation.

The fifth and sixth ``codeUnit`` values (``55357`` and ``56374``), however,
are a UTF-16 surrogate pair representation of the üê∂ character.
In UTF code point terms, these values are a lead surrogate value of ``U+D83D``,
and a trail surrogate value of ``U+DC36``.

Unicode Scalars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The third and final Unicode representation of a ``String``
enables you to access the string as a collection of Unicode scalars.
A Unicode scalar is any 21-bit Unicode code point that is not
a lead surrogate or trail surrogate code point.

You can access a Unicode scalar representation of a ``String`` value
by iterating over its ``unicodeScalars`` property.
This property is of type ``UnicodeScalarView``,
which is a collection of ``UnicodeScalar`` values,
Each ``UnicodeScalar`` has a ``value`` property that returns
the scalar's 21-bit code point, represented within a ``UInt32`` value:

.. testcode:: unicodeRepresentations

   -> for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
         print("\(scalar.value) ")
      }
   -> print("\n")
   </ 68 111 103 33 128054

The ``value`` property for the first four ``UnicodeScalar`` values
(``68``, ``111``, ``103``, ``33``)
once again represent the characters ``D``, ``o``, ``g``, and ``!``.
The ``value`` property of the fifth and final ``UnicodeScalar``, ``128054``,
is a decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal value ``1F436``,
which is equivalent to the Unicode code point ``U+1F436``, or üê∂.

As an alternative to querying their ``value`` property,
each ``UnicodeScalar`` value can also be used to construct a new ``String`` value,
such as with string interpolation:

.. testcode:: unicodeRepresentations

   -> for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
         println("\(scalar) ")
      }
   </ D 
   </ o 
   </ g 
   </ ! 
   </ üê∂
