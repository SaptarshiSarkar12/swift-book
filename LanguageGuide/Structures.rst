Structures
==========

:newTerm:`Structures` in Swift are
general-purpose, flexible building blocks for your program.
They are far more powerful than the simple structures you may be familiar with
from other languages such as C and Objective-C,
providing new ways to architect your code for optimal safety and performance.

In Swift, structures can:

* Define properties to store values, as described in :doc:`Properties`.
* Define methods to provide functionality, as described in :doc:`Methods`.
* Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax,
  as described in :doc:`Subscripts`.
* Define initializers to set up their initial state,
  as described in :doc:`Initialization`.
* Be extended to provide added functionality,
  as described in :doc:`Extensions`.
* Conform to protocols to implement a shared abstraction or cooperate
  with a default implementation, as described in :doc:`Protocols`.

.. _Structures_StructureSyntax:

Structure Syntax
----------------

You introduce a structure with the ``struct`` keyword and place its
definition within a pair of braces:

.. testcode:: structures
    
    -> struct SomeStructure {
           // structure definition goes here
       }
    
When you define a structure,
you create a brand new Swift type.
Give types ``UpperCamelCase`` names,
such as ``SomeStructure`` here,
to match the capitalization of standard Swift types
such as ``String``, ``Int``, and ``Bool``.
Conversely, give properties and methods ``lowerCamelCase`` names,
such as ``someProperty`` and ``someMethod``,
to differentiate them from type names.

Here is an example of a structure definition:

.. testcode:: structures

    -> struct Temperature {
           var celsius = 0.0
           var fahrenheit: Double {
               return celsius * 9/5 + 32
           }
       }

The example above defines a new structure called ``Temperature``.
The structure has  a stored property called ``celsius`` and
a computed property called ``fahrenheit``.
Stored properties are constants or variables
that are bundled up and stored as part of the structure.
Computed properties calculate a value rather than storing it.
The degrees in Fahrenheit of a ``Temperature``
can always be determined from its stored ``celsius`` property,
so there is no need to store a second value for ``fahrenheit``.
For more information about stored and computed properties,
see :doc:`Properties`.

The ``celsius`` property is inferred to be of type ``Double``
because of its initial floating-point value of ``0.0``,
so it is inferred to be of type ``Double``.
as discussed in :ref:`TheBasics_TypeSafetyAndTypeInference`.
Because ``fahrenheit`` is a computed property,
it is explicitly defined as a ``Double``.

The ``Temperature`` structure definition describes only
what a ``Temperature`` instance looks like.
It does not describe a specific ``Temperature`` instance.
To do that, you create an instance of the structure.
The simplest form of initialization syntax for structures
uses the type name of the structure
followed by empty parentheses:

.. testcode:: structures

    -> let someTemperature = Temperature()
    << // someTemperature : Temperature = REPL.Temperature(celsius: 0.0)

This creates a new instance of the ``Temperature`` structure
and initializes its properties to their default values.

.. _Structures_MemberwiseInitializer:

Initializing a Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All structures have an initializer that's implemented for you by the compiler,
known as a :newterm:`memberwise initializer`,
although you can also define your own initializers.
The memberwise initializer lets you create an instance of the structure
by providing a value for each of the structure's stored properties.

.. testcode:: structures

    -> let waterBoilingPoint = Temperature(celsius: 100.0)
    << // waterBoilingPoint : Temperature = REPL.Temperature(celsius: 100.0)

Initializing ``waterBoilingPoint`` with the memberwise initializer
creates an instance of ``Temperature`` with the ``celsius`` property
set to ``100.0`` degrees Celsius.

For information on structure initialization, see :doc:`Initialization`.

.. _Structures_AccessingPropertiesOfStructures:

Accessing Properties and Methods of Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You access a property or a method of a structure instance using dot syntax.
Write the name of the instance,
followed by a period (``.``) and the name of the property or method:

.. testcode:: structures

    -> print("Water boils at \(waterBoilingPoint.celsius) degrees Celsius")
    <- Water boils at 100.0 degrees Celsius

In the example above, ``waterBoilingPoint.celsius``
refers to the ``celsius`` property of ``waterBoilingPoint``
and returns its value of ``100.0``.

You can also use dot syntax
to assign a new value to a variable property:

.. testcode:: structures

    -> var bodyTemperature = Temperature()
    << // bodyTemperature : Temperature = REPL.Temperature(celsius: 0.0)
    -> bodyTemperature.celsius = 37.0
    -> print("Body temperature is \(bodyTemperature.celsius) degrees Celsius")
    <- Body temperature is 37.0 degrees Celsius
    -> print("Body temperature is \(bodyTemperature.fahrenheit) degrees Fahrenheit")
    <- Body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit

The example above declares a variable called ``bodyTemperature``
and sets it to a ``Temperature`` instance
with all properties initialized to their default values.
The ``bodyTemperature`` variable's ``celsius`` property is set,
and then its ``celsius`` and ``fahrenheit`` properties are accessed
to print their values.

.. _Structures_StructuresAreValueTypes:

Structures Are Value Types
--------------------------

A :newTerm:`value type` is a type whose value is copied
when it is assigned to a variable or constant,
or when it is passed to a function.
You've already been using value types extensively
throughout the previous chapters.
All the basic types in Swift ---
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays, and dictionaries ---
are value types,
and are implemented as structures in the standard library.

.. XXX Enums are also value types,
   as discussed in Enumerations_EnumerationsAreValueTypes

Custom structures
that you build on top of existing standard library value types
are also value types.
(However, a structure with a property of some class type
might not be a value type,
because the class isn't a value type.)
This means that any structure instances you create ---
and any value types you give them as properties ---
are copied when they are passed around in your code.
For example, consider the following code
which keeps track of the temperature of a room
and the temperature of the oven in that room.

.. testcode:: structures

    -> var roomTemperature = Temperature(celsius: 21.0)
    << // roomTemperature : Temperature = REPL.Temperature(celsius: 21.0)
    -> var ovenTemperature = roomTemperature
    << // ovenTemperature : Temperature = REPL.Temperature(celsius: 21.0)

The example above declares a variable called ``roomTemperature``,
which is set to a ``Temperature`` instance initialized
with a typical ambient room temperature of ``21.0`` degrees Celsius.
It also declares a variable called ``ovenTemperature`` ---
because the oven is turned off,
its temperature is the same as the room's temperature.
Because ``Temperature`` is a structure, a *copy*
of the existing ``roomTemperature`` instance is made,
and this new copy is assigned to ``ovenTemperature``.
Even though ``roomTemperature`` and ``ovenTemperature``
have the same value for their ``celsius`` properties,
they are two different instances.
You can change ``ovenTemperature`` to get the oven ready for cooking,
but ``roomTemperature`` remains unchanged:

.. testcode:: structures

    -> ovenTemperature.celsius = 180.0
    -> print("ovenTemperature is now \(ovenTemperature.celsius) degrees Celsius")
    <- ovenTemperature is now 180.0 degrees Celsius
    -> print("roomTemperature is still \(roomTemperature.celsius) degrees Celsius")
    <- roomTemperature is still 21.0 degrees Celsius

.. XXX diagram showing (lack of) shared mutable state

.. note::

   Swift uses an optimization called :newTerm:`copy-on-write`,
   sometimes abbreviated "COW",
   to reduce the number of copies it makes of a given value.
   Your code behaves as though structure instances are copied
   when you assign them to a new variable or constant,
   but Swift doesn't actually make a copy immediately.
   Instead, Swift uses the existing instance in both places.
   This works because,
   if Swift had made a copy of the instance,
   the original instance would be identical to the copy.
   If one place mutates the instance,
   then the original instance and the copy are no longer identical,
   and they can't be shared any more ---
   this means Swift has to make a copy and mutate the copy.

   In the standard library,
   types like ``Array`` and ``Dictionary`` and ``String``
   that take up larger amounts of memory
   implement copy-on-write,
   but some small types like ``Int`` don't implement this optimization.
   Your custom structures whose properties are structures from the standard library
   get copy-on-write behavior automatically.
   However, if you declare structures
   that have a property whose type is a class,
   you need to do some additional work to copy the instance of the class
   when a shared instance of the structure is mutated.
   For more information, see the
   `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:) <https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/2430721-isknownuniquelyreferenced>`_ function.

   .. FIXME: It would be much better to have the function name
      actually in code voice.
      I haven't found any way to make that work with RST's link markup.
      This is a workaround for <rdar://problem/17682758> RST: Add support for uAPI links

   .. No example of implementing COW for a struct that contains a class,
      because it's too complicated.
      You need a willSet at every point where the struct can be mutated,
      and then inside it you have to copy the class property
      if it isn't uniquely referenced.

.. XXX General question: what happens when I put a class instance inside a struct?
   In particular, call out the fact that this breaks value semantics,
   because copies of the struct all refer to the same classs instance.
   In contrast, composing value semantics preserves value semantics.

and when to use them,
see :doc:`ReferenceAndValueTypes`.
