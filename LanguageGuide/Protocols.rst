Protocols
=========

A :newTerm:`protocol` defines a blueprint of
methods, properties, and other requirements
that suit a particular task or piece of functionality.
The protocol doesn't actually provide an implementation for any of these requirements ---
it only describes what an implementation will look like.
The protocol can then be :newTerm:`adopted` by a class, structure, or enumeration
to provide an actual implementation of those requirements.
Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to
:newTerm:`conform` to that protocol.

Protocols can require that conforming types have specific
instance properties, instance methods, type methods, operators, and subscripts.

.. FIXME: Protocols should also be able to support initializers,
   and indeed you can currently write them,
   but they don't work due to
   <rdar://problem/13695680> Constructor requirements in protocols (needed for NSCoding).
   I'll need to write about them once this is fixed.
   UPDATE: actually, they *can* be used right now,
   but only in a generic function, and not more generally with the protocol type.
   I'm not sure I should mention them in this chapter until they work more generally.

.. TODO: When I add in the fact that protocols support initializers,
   I should also mention that implementations of those initialiers
   must be marked as "required" if the conforming class is non-final.

.. _Protocols_ProtocolSyntax:

Protocol Syntax
---------------

You define protocols in a very similar way to classes, structures, and enumerations:

.. testcode:: protocolSyntax

   -> protocol SomeProtocol {
         // protocol definition goes here
      }

Custom types state that they adopt a particular protocol
by placing the protocol's name after the type's name,
separated by a colon, as part of their definition.
Multiple protocols can be listed, and are separated by commas:

.. testcode:: protocolSyntax

   >> protocol FirstProtocol {}
   >> protocol AnotherProtocol {}
   -> struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
         // structure definition goes here
      }

If a class has a superclass, list the superclass name
before any protocols it adopts, followed by a comma:

.. testcode:: protocolSyntax

   >> class SomeSuperclass {}
   -> class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
         // class definition goes here
      }

.. _Protocols_PropertyRequirements:

Property Requirements
---------------------

A protocol can require any conforming type to provide
an instance property or type property with a particular name and type.
The protocol doesn't specify whether the property should be
a stored property or a computed property ---
it only specifies the required property name and type.
The protocol also specifies whether each property must be gettable
or gettable *and* settable.

If a protocol requires a property to be gettable and settable,
that property requirement cannot be fulfilled by
a constant stored property or a read-only computed property.
If the protocol only requires a property to be gettable,
the requirement can be satisfied by any kind of property,
and it is valid for the property to be also settable
if this is useful for your own code.

Property requirements are always declared as variable properties,
prefixed with the ``var`` keyword.
Gettable and settable properties are indicated by writing
``{ get set }`` after their type declaration,
and gettable properties are indicated by writing ``{ get }``.

.. testcode:: instanceProperties

   -> protocol SomeProtocol {
         var mustBeSettable: Int { get set }
         var doesNotNeedToBeSettable: Int { get }
      }

Always prefix type property requirements with the ``class`` keyword
when you define them in a protocol.
This rule pertains even though type property requirements are prefixed with
the ``static`` keyword when implemented by a structure or enumeration:

.. testcode:: instanceProperties

   -> protocol AnotherProtocol {
         class var someTypeProperty: Int { get set }
      }

Here's an example of a protocol with a single instance property requirement:

.. testcode:: instanceProperties

   -> protocol FullyNamed {
         var fullName: String { get }
      }

The ``FullyNamed`` protocol requires a conforming type to provide a fully-qualified name.
The protocol doesn't specify anything else about the nature of the conforming type ---
it only specifies that the type must be able to provide a full name for itself.
The protocol states that any ``FullyNamed`` type must have
a gettable instance property called ``fullName``, which is of type ``String``.

Here's an example of a simple structure that adopts and conforms to
the ``FullyNamed`` protocol:

.. testcode:: instanceProperties

   -> struct Person: FullyNamed {
         var fullName: String
      }
   -> let john = Person(fullName: "John Appleseed")
   << // john : Person = REPL.Person
   /> john.fullName is \"\(john.fullName)\"
   </ john.fullName is "John Appleseed"

This example defines a structure called ``Person``,
which represents a specific named person.
It states that it adopts the ``FullyNamed`` protocol
as part of the first line of its definition.

Each instance of ``Person`` has a single stored property called ``fullName``,
which is of type ``String``.
This matches the single requirement of the ``FullyNamed`` protocol,
and means that ``Person`` has correctly conformed to the protocol.
(Swift reports an error at compile-time if a protocol requirement is not fulfilled.)

Here's a more complex class, which also adopts and conforms to the ``FullyNamed`` protocol:

.. testcode:: instanceProperties

   -> class Starship: FullyNamed {
         var prefix: String?
         var name: String
         init(name: String, prefix: String? = nil) {
            self.name = name
            self.prefix = prefix
         }
         var fullName: String {
            return (prefix != nil ? prefix! + " " : "") + name
         }
      }
   -> var ncc1701 = Starship(name: "Enterprise", prefix: "USS")
   << // ncc1701 : Starship = REPL.Starship
   /> ncc1701.fullName is \"\(ncc1701.fullName)\"
   </ ncc1701.fullName is "USS Enterprise"

This class implements the ``fullName`` property requirement as
a computed read-only property for a starship.
Each ``Starship`` class instance stores a mandatory ``name`` and an optional ``prefix``.
The ``fullName`` property uses the ``prefix`` value if it exists,
and prepends it to the beginning of ``name`` to create a full name for the starship.

.. TODO: add some advice on how protocols should be named

.. _Protocols_MethodRequirements:

Method Requirements
-------------------

Protocols can require specific instance methods and type methods
to be implemented by conforming types.
These methods are written as part of the protocol's definition
in exactly the same way as for normal instance and type methods,
but without curly braces or a method body.
Variadic parameters are allowed, subject to the same rules as for normal methods.
Default values, however, cannot be specified for method parameters within a protocol's definition.

As with type property requirements,
you always prefix type method requirements with the ``class`` keyword
when they are defined in a protocol.
This is true even though type method requirements are prefixed with
the ``static`` keyword when implemented by a structure or enumeration:

.. testcode:: typeMethods

   -> protocol SomeProtocol {
         class func someTypeMethod()
      }

The following example defines a protocol with a single instance method requirement:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
         func random() -> Double
      }

This protocol, ``RandomNumberGenerator``, requires any conforming type
to have an instance method called ``random``,
which returns a ``Double`` value whenever it is called.
Although it is not specified as part of the protocol,
it is assumed that this value will be
a number from ``0.0`` up to (but not including) ``1.0``.

The ``RandomNumberGenerator`` protocol does not make any assumptions
about how each random number will be generated ---
it simply requires the generator to provide a standard way
to generate a new random number.

Here's an implementation of a class that adopts and conforms to
the ``RandomNumberGenerator`` protocol.
This class implements a pseudorandom number generator algorithm known as
a :newTerm:`linear congruential generator`:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator {
         var lastRandom = 42.0
         let m = 139968.0
         let a = 3877.0
         let c = 29573.0
         func random() -> Double {
            lastRandom = ((lastRandom * a + c) % m)
            return lastRandom / m
         }
      }
   -> let generator = LinearCongruentialGenerator()
   -> println("Here's a random number: \(generator.random())")
   <- Here's a random number: 0.37464991998171
   -> println("And another one: \(generator.random())")
   <- And another one: 0.729023776863283

.. _Protocols_MutatingMethodRequirements:

Mutating Method Requirements
----------------------------

It is sometimes necessary for a method to modify (or *mutate*) the instance it belongs to.
For instance methods on value types (that is, structures and enumerations)
you place the ``mutating`` keyword before a method's ``func`` keyword
to indicate that the method is allowed to modify the instance it belongs to
and/or any properties of that instance.
This process is described in :ref:`Methods_ModifyingValueTypesFromWithinInstanceMethods`.

If you define a protocol instance method requirement
that is intended to mutate instances of any type that adopts the protocol,
mark the method with the ``mutating`` keyword
as part of the protocol's definition.
This enables structures and enumerations to adopt the protocol
and satisfy that method requirement.

.. note::

   If you mark a protocol instance method requirement as ``mutating``,
   you do not need to write the ``mutating`` keyword when writing
   an implementation of that method for a class.
   The ``mutating`` keyword is only used by structures and enumerations.

The example below defines a protocol called ``Togglable``,
which defines a single instance method requirement called ``toggle``.
As its name suggests, the ``toggle()`` method is intended to
toggle or invert the state of any conforming type,
typically by modifying a property of that type.

The ``toggle()`` method is marked with the ``mutating`` keyword
as part of the ``Togglable`` protocol definition,
to indicate that the method is expected to mutate the state of a conforming instance
when it is called:

.. testcode:: mutatingRequirements

   -> protocol Togglable {
         mutating func toggle()
      }

If you implement the ``Togglable`` protocol for a structure or enumeration,
that structure or enumeration can conform to the protocol
by providing an implementation of the ``toggle()`` method
that is also marked as ``mutating``.

The example below defines an enumeration called ``OnOffSwitch``.
This enumeration toggles between two states,
indicated by the enumeration cases ``On`` and ``Off``.
The enumeration's ``toggle`` implementation is marked as ``mutating``,
to match the ``Togglable`` protocol's requirements:

.. testcode:: mutatingRequirements

   -> enum OnOffSwitch: Togglable {
         case Off, On
         mutating func toggle() {
            switch self {
               case Off:
                  self = On
               case On:
                  self = Off
            }
         }
      }
   -> var lightSwitch = OnOffSwitch.Off
   << // lightSwitch : OnOffSwitch = (Enum Value)
   -> lightSwitch.toggle()
   // lightSwitch is now equal to .On

.. _Protocols_InitializerRequirements:

Initializer Requirements
------------------------

Protocols can require specific initializers
to be implemented by conforming types.
You write these initializers as part of the protocol's definition
in exactly the same way as for normal initializers,
but without curly braces or an initializer body:

.. testcode:: initializers

   -> protocol SomeProtocol {
         init(someParameter: Int)
      }

.. _Protocols_ClassImplementationsOfProtocolInitializerRequirements:

Class Implementations of Protocol Initializer Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can implement a protocol initializer requirement on a conforming class
as either a designated initializer or a convenience initializer.
In both cases,
you must mark the initializer implementation with the ``required`` modifier:

.. testcode:: initializers

   -> class SomeClass: SomeProtocol {
         required init(someParameter: Int) {
            // initializer implementation goes here
         }
      }

.. assertion:: protocolInitializerRequirementsCanBeImplementedAsDesignatedOrConvenience

   -> protocol P {
         init(x: Int)
      }
   -> class C1: P {
         required init(x: Int) {}
      }
   -> class C2: P {
         init() {}
         required convenience init(x: Int) {
            self.init()
         }
      }

The use of the ``required`` modifier ensures that
you provide an explicit or inherited implementation of the initializer requirement
on all subclasses of the conforming class,
such that they also conform to the protocol.

For more information on required initializers,
see :ref:`Initialization_RequiredInitializers`.

.. assertion:: protocolInitializerRequirementsRequireTheRequiredModifierOnTheImplementingClass

   -> protocol P {
         init(s: String)
      }
   -> class C1: P {
         required init(s: String) {}
      }
   -> class C2: P {
         init(s: String) {}
      }
   !! <REPL Input>:2:6: error: initializer requirement 'init(s:)' can only be satisfied by a `required` initializer in non-final class 'C2'
   !! init(s: String) {}
   !! ^
   !! required

.. assertion:: protocolInitializerRequirementsRequireTheRequiredModifierOnSubclasses

   -> protocol P {
         init(s: String)
      }
   -> class C: P {
         required init(s: String) {}
      }
   -> class D1: C {
         required init(s: String) { super.init(s: s) }
      }
   -> class D2: C {
         init(s: String) { super.init(s: s) }
      }
   !! <REPL Input>:2:6: error: 'required' modifier must be present on all overrides of a required initializer
   !! init(s: String) { super.init(s: s) }
   !! ^
   !! required
   !! <REPL Input>:2:15: note: overridden required initializer is here
   !! required init(s: String) {}
   !! ^

.. note::

   You do not need to mark protocol initializer implementations with the ``required`` modifier
   on classes that are marked with the ``final`` modifier,
   because final classes cannot be subclassed.
   For more on the ``final`` modifier, see :ref:`Inheritance_PreventingOverrides`.

.. assertion:: finalClassesDoNotNeedTheRequiredModifierForProtocolInitializerRequirements

   -> protocol P {
         init(s: String)
      }
   -> final class C1: P {
         required init(s: String) {}
      }
   -> final class C2: P {
         init(s: String) {}
      }

If a subclass overrides a designated initializer from a superclass,
and also implements a matching initializer requirement from a protocol,
mark the initializer implementation with both the ``required`` and ``override`` modifiers:

.. testcode:: requiredOverrideInitializers

   -> protocol SomeProtocol {
         init()
      }
   ---
   -> class SomeSuperClass {
         init() {
            // initializer implementation goes here
         }
      }
   ---
   -> class SomeSubClass: SomeSuperClass, SomeProtocol {
         // "required" from SomeProtocol conformance; "override" from SomeSuperClass
         required override init() {
            // initializer implementation goes here
         }
      }

.. _Protocols_FailableInitializerRequirements:

Failable Initializer Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protocols can define failable initializer requirements for conforming types,
as defined in :ref:`Initialization_FailableInitializers`.

A failable initializer requirement can be satisfied by
a failable or nonfailable initializer on a conforming type.
A nonfailable initializer requirement can be satisfied by
a nonfailable initializer or an implicitly unwrapped failable initializer.

.. assertion:: failableRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByFailableInitializer

   -> protocol P { init?(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init?(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init?(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: failableRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByIUOInitializer

   -> protocol P { init?(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init!(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init!(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: iuoRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByFailableInitializer

   -> protocol P { init!(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init?(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init?(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: iuoRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByIUOInitializer

   -> protocol P { init!(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init!(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init!(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: failableRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByNonFailableInitializer

   -> protocol P { init?(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: iuoRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByNonFailableInitializer

   -> protocol P { init!(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: nonFailableRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByNonFailableInitializer

   -> protocol P { init(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init(i: Int) {} }

.. assertion:: nonFailableRequirementCanBeSatisfiedByIUOInitializer

   -> protocol P { init(i: Int) }
   -> class C: P { required init!(i: Int) {} }
   -> struct S: P { init!(i: Int) {} }

.. _Protocols_ProtocolsAsTypes:

Protocols as Types
------------------

Protocols do not actually implement any functionality themselves.
Nonetheless, any protocol you create will become a fully-fledged type for use in your code.

Because it is a type,
you can use a protocol in many places where other types are allowed, including:

* As a parameter type or return type in a function, method, or initializer
* As the type of a constant, variable, or property
* As the type of items in an array, dictionary, or other container

.. note::

   Because protocols are types,
   begin their names with a capital letter
   (such as ``FullyNamed`` and ``RandomNumberGenerator``)
   to match the names of other types in Swift
   (such as ``Int``, ``String``, and ``Double``).

.. TODO: what else should be on this list? And should it actually be complete?

Here's an example of a protocol used as a type:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> class Dice {
         let sides: Int
         let generator: RandomNumberGenerator
         init(sides: Int, generator: RandomNumberGenerator) {
            self.sides = sides
            self.generator = generator
         }
         func roll() -> Int {
            return Int(generator.random() * Double(sides)) + 1
         }
      }

This example defines a new class called ``Dice``,
which represents an *n*-sided dice for use in a board game.
``Dice`` instances have an integer property called ``sides``,
which represents how many sides they have,
and a property called ``generator``,
which provides a random number generator
from which to create dice roll values.

The ``generator`` property is of type ``RandomNumberGenerator``.
Therefore, you can set it to an instance of
*any* type that adopts the ``RandomNumberGenerator`` protocol.
Nothing else is required of the instance you assign to this property,
except that the instance must adopt the ``RandomNumberGenerator`` protocol.

``Dice`` also has an initializer, to set up its initial state.
This initializer has a parameter called ``generator``,
which is also of type ``RandomNumberGenerator``.
You can pass a value of any conforming type in to this parameter
when initializing a new ``Dice`` instance.

``Dice`` provides one instance method, ``roll``,
which returns an integer value between 1 and the number of sides on the dice.
This method calls the generator's ``random()`` method to create
a new random number between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``,
and uses this random number to create a dice roll value within the correct range.
Because ``generator`` is known to adopt ``RandomNumberGenerator``,
it is guaranteed to have a ``random()`` method to call.

.. QUESTION: would it be better to show Dice using a RandomNumberGenerator
   as a data source, a la UITableViewDataSource etc.?

.. TODO: mention that you can only do RandomNumberGenerator-like things
   with this property, because the property is only known to be a
   RandomNumberGenerator.

Here's how the ``Dice`` class can be used to create a six-sided dice
with a ``LinearCongruentialGenerator`` instance as its random number generator:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> var d6 = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
   -> for _ in 1...5 {
         println("Random dice roll is \(d6.roll())")
      }
   </ Random dice roll is 3
   </ Random dice roll is 5
   </ Random dice roll is 4
   </ Random dice roll is 5
   </ Random dice roll is 4

.. _Protocols_Delegation:

Delegation
----------

:newTerm:`Delegation` is a design pattern that enables
a class or structure to hand off (or *delegate*)
some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type.
This design pattern is implemented by defining
a protocol that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities,
such that a conforming type (known as a delegate)
is guaranteed to provide the functionality that has been delegated.
Delegation can be used to respond to a particular action,
or to retrieve data from an external source without needing to know
the underlying type of that source.

The example below defines two protocols for use with dice-based board games:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> protocol DiceGame {
         var dice: Dice { get }
         func play()
      }
   -> protocol DiceGameDelegate {
         func gameDidStart(game: DiceGame)
         func game(game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int)
         func gameDidEnd(game: DiceGame)
      }

The ``DiceGame`` protocol is a protocol that can be adopted
by any game that involves dice.
The ``DiceGameDelegate`` protocol can be adopted by
any type to track the progress of a ``DiceGame``.

.. QUESTION: is the Cocoa-style x:didStuffWithY: naming approach
   the right thing to advise for delegates written in Swift?
   It looks a little odd in the syntax above.

Here's a version of the *Snakes and Ladders* game originally introduced in :doc:`ControlFlow`.
This version is adapted to use a ``Dice`` instance for its dice-rolls;
to adopt the ``DiceGame`` protocol;
and to notify a ``DiceGameDelegate`` about its progress:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> class SnakesAndLadders: DiceGame {
         let finalSquare = 25
         let dice = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
         var square = 0
         var board: [Int]
         init() {
            board = [Int](count: finalSquare + 1, repeatedValue: 0)
            board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
            board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
         }
         var delegate: DiceGameDelegate?
         func play() {
            square = 0
            delegate?.gameDidStart(self)
            gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
               let diceRoll = dice.roll()
               delegate?.game(self, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll: diceRoll)
               switch square + diceRoll {
                  case finalSquare:
                     break gameLoop
                  case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
                     continue gameLoop
                  default:
                     square += diceRoll
                     square += board[square]
               }
            }
            delegate?.gameDidEnd(self)
         }
      }

For a description of the *Snakes and Ladders* gameplay,
see the :ref:`ControlFlow_Break` section of the :doc:`ControlFlow` chapter.

This version of the game is wrapped up as a class called ``SnakesAndLadders``,
which adopts the ``DiceGame`` protocol.
It provides a gettable ``dice`` property and a ``play()`` method
in order to conform to the protocol.
(The ``dice`` property is declared as a constant property
because it does not need to change after initialization,
and the protocol only requires that it is gettable.)

The *Snakes and Ladders* game board setup takes place within
the class's ``init()`` initializer.
All game logic is moved into the protocol's ``play`` method,
which uses the protocol's required ``dice`` property to provide its dice roll values.

Note that the ``delegate`` property is defined as an *optional* ``DiceGameDelegate``,
because a delegate isn't required in order to play the game.
Because it is of an optional type,
the ``delegate`` property is automatically set to an initial value of ``nil``.
Thereafter, the game instantiator has the option to set the property to a suitable delegate.

``DiceGameDelegate`` provides three methods for tracking the progress of a game.
These three methods have been incorporated into the game logic within
the ``play()`` method above, and are called when
a new game starts, a new turn begins, or the game ends.

Because the ``delegate`` property is an *optional* ``DiceGameDelegate``,
the ``play()`` method uses optional chaining each time it calls a method on the delegate.
If the ``delegate`` property is nil,
these delegate calls fail gracefully and without error.
If the ``delegate`` property is non-nil,
the delegate methods are called,
and are passed the ``SnakesAndLadders`` instance as a parameter.

.. TODO: add a cross-reference to optional chaining here.

This next example shows a class called ``DiceGameTracker``,
which adopts the ``DiceGameDelegate`` protocol:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> class DiceGameTracker: DiceGameDelegate {
         var numberOfTurns = 0
         func gameDidStart(game: DiceGame) {
            numberOfTurns = 0
            if game is SnakesAndLadders {
               println("Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders")
            }
            println("The game is using a \(game.dice.sides)-sided dice")
         }
         func game(game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int) {
            ++numberOfTurns
            println("Rolled a \(diceRoll)")
         }
         func gameDidEnd(game: DiceGame) {
            println("The game lasted for \(numberOfTurns) turns")
         }
      }

``DiceGameTracker`` implements all three methods required by ``DiceGameDelegate``.
It uses these methods to keep track of the number of turns a game has taken.
It resets a ``numberOfTurns`` property to zero when the game starts,
increments it each time a new turn begins,
and prints out the total number of turns once the game has ended.

The implementation of ``gameDidStart`` shown above uses the ``game`` parameter
to print some introductory information about the game that is about to be played.
The ``game`` parameter has a type of ``DiceGame``, not ``SnakesAndLadders``,
and so ``gameDidStart`` can access and use only methods and properties that
are implemented as part of the ``DiceGame`` protocol.
However, the method is still able to use type casting to
query the type of the underlying instance.
In this example, it checks whether ``game`` is actually
an instance of ``SnakesAndLadders`` behind the scenes,
and prints an appropriate message if so.

``gameDidStart`` also accesses the ``dice`` property of the passed ``game`` parameter.
Because ``game`` is known to conform to the ``DiceGame`` protocol,
it is guaranteed to have a ``dice`` property,
and so the ``gameDidStart(_:)`` method is able to access and print the dice's ``sides`` property,
regardless of what kind of game is being played.

Here's how ``DiceGameTracker`` looks in action:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> let tracker = DiceGameTracker()
   -> let game = SnakesAndLadders()
   -> game.delegate = tracker
   -> game.play()
   </ Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders
   </ The game is using a 6-sided dice
   </ Rolled a 3
   </ Rolled a 5
   </ Rolled a 4
   </ Rolled a 5
   </ The game lasted for 4 turns

.. _Protocols_AddingProtocolConformanceWithAnExtension:

Adding Protocol Conformance with an Extension
---------------------------------------------

You can extend an existing type to adopt and conform to a new protocol,
even if you do not have access to the source code for the existing type.
Extensions can add new properties, methods, and subscripts to an existing type,
and are therefore able to add any requirements that a protocol may demand.
For more about extensions, see :doc:`Extensions`.

.. note::

   Existing instances of a type automatically adopt and conform to a protocol
   when that conformance is added to the instance's type in an extension.

For example, this protocol, called ``TextRepresentable``, can be implemented by
any type that has a way to be represented as text.
This might be a description of itself, or a text version of its current state:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> protocol TextRepresentable {
         func asText() -> String
      }

The ``Dice`` class from earlier can be extended to adopt and conform to ``TextRepresentable``:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> extension Dice: TextRepresentable {
         func asText() -> String {
            return "A \(sides)-sided dice"
         }
      }

This extension adopts the new protocol in exactly the same way
as if ``Dice`` had provided it in its original implementation.
The protocol name is provided after the type name, separated by a colon,
and an implementation of all requirements of the protocol
is provided within the extension's curly braces.

Any ``Dice`` instance can now be treated as ``TextRepresentable``:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> let d12 = Dice(sides: 12, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
   -> println(d12.asText())
   <- A 12-sided dice

Similarly, the ``SnakesAndLadders`` game class can be extended to
adopt and conform to the ``TextRepresentable`` protocol:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> extension SnakesAndLadders: TextRepresentable {
         func asText() -> String {
            return "A game of Snakes and Ladders with \(finalSquare) squares"
         }
      }
   -> println(game.asText())
   <- A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares

.. _Protocols_DeclaringProtocolAdoptionWithAnExtension:

Declaring Protocol Adoption with an Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a type already conforms to all of the requirements of a protocol,
but has not yet stated that it adopts that protocol,
you can make it adopt the protocol with an empty extension:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> struct Hamster {
         var name: String
         func asText() -> String {
            return "A hamster named \(name)"
         }
      }
   -> extension Hamster: TextRepresentable {}

Instances of ``Hamster`` can now be used wherever ``TextRepresentable`` is the required type:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> let simonTheHamster = Hamster(name: "Simon")
   -> let somethingTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable = simonTheHamster
   -> println(somethingTextRepresentable.asText())
   <- A hamster named Simon

.. note::

   Types do not automatically adopt a protocol just by satisfying its requirements.
   They must always explicitly declare their adoption of the protocol.

.. _Protocols_CollectionsOfProtocolTypes:

Collections of Protocol Types
-----------------------------

A protocol can be used as the type to be stored in
a collection such as an array or a dictionary,
as mentioned in :ref:`Protocols_ProtocolsAsTypes`.
This example creates an array of ``TextRepresentable`` things:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> let things: [TextRepresentable] = [game, d12, simonTheHamster]

It is now possible to iterate over the items in the array,
and print each item's textual representation:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> for thing in things {
         println(thing.asText())
      }
   </ A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares
   </ A 12-sided dice
   </ A hamster named Simon

Note that the ``thing`` constant is of type ``TextRepresentable``.
It is not of type ``Dice``, or ``DiceGame``, or ``Hamster``,
even if the actual instance behind the scenes is of one of those types.
Nonetheless, because it is of type ``TextRepresentable``,
and anything that is ``TextRepresentable`` is known to have an ``asText()`` method,
it is safe to call ``thing.asText`` each time through the loop.

.. _Protocols_ProtocolInheritance:

Protocol Inheritance
--------------------

A protocol can :newTerm:`inherit` one or more other protocols
and can add further requirements on top of the requirements it inherits.
The syntax for protocol inheritance is similar to the syntax for class inheritance,
but with the option to list multiple inherited protocols, separated by commas:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   >> protocol SomeProtocol {}
   >> protocol AnotherProtocol {}
   -> protocol InheritingProtocol: SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
         // protocol definition goes here
      }

Here's an example of a protocol that inherits
the ``TextRepresentable`` protocol from above:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> protocol PrettyTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable {
         func asPrettyText() -> String
      }

This example defines a new protocol, ``PrettyTextRepresentable``,
which inherits from ``TextRepresentable``.
Anything that adopts ``PrettyTextRepresentable`` must satisfy all of the requirements
enforced by ``TextRepresentable``,
*plus* the additional requirements enforced by ``PrettyTextRepresentable``.
In this example, ``PrettyTextRepresentable`` adds a single requirement
to provide an instance method called ``asPrettyText`` that returns a ``String``.

The ``SnakesAndLadders`` class can be extended to adopt and conform to ``PrettyTextRepresentable``:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> extension SnakesAndLadders: PrettyTextRepresentable {
         func asPrettyText() -> String {
            var output = asText() + ":\n"
            for index in 1...finalSquare {
               switch board[index] {
                  case let ladder where ladder > 0:
                     output += "▲ "
                  case let snake where snake < 0:
                     output += "▼ "
                  default:
                     output += "○ "
               }
            }
            return output
         }
      }

This extension states that it adopts the ``PrettyTextRepresentable`` protocol
and provides an implementation of the ``asPrettyText()`` method
for the ``SnakesAndLadders`` type.
Anything that is ``PrettyTextRepresentable`` must also be ``TextRepresentable``,
and so the ``asPrettyText`` implementation starts by calling the ``asText()`` method
from the ``TextRepresentable`` protocol to begin an output string.
It appends a colon and a line break,
and uses this as the start of its pretty text representation.
It then iterates through the array of board squares,
and appends a geometric shape to represent the contents of each square:

* If the square's value is greater than ``0``, it is the base of a ladder,
  and is represented by ``▲``.
* If the square's value is less than ``0``, it is the head of a snake,
  and is represented by ``▼``.
* Otherwise, the square's value is ``0``, and it is a “free” square,
  represented by ``○``.

The method implementation can now be used to print a pretty text description
of any ``SnakesAndLadders`` instance:

.. testcode:: protocols
   :compile: true

   -> println(game.asPrettyText())
   </ A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares:
   </ ○ ○ ▲ ○ ○ ▲ ○ ○ ▲ ▲ ○ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ○ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ▼ ○

.. _Protocols_ClassOnlyProtocols:

Class-Only Protocols
--------------------

You can limit protocol adoption to class types (and not structures or enumerations)
by adding the ``class`` keyword to a protocol's inheritance list.
The ``class`` keyword must always appear first in a protocol's inheritance list,
before any inherited protocols:

.. testcode:: classOnlyProtocols

   >> protocol SomeInheritedProtocol {}
   -> protocol SomeClassOnlyProtocol: class, SomeInheritedProtocol {
         // class-only protocol definition goes here
      }

In the example above, ``SomeClassOnlyProtocol`` can only be adopted by class types.
It is a compile-time error to write a structure or enumeration definition
that tries to adopt ``SomeClassOnlyProtocol``.

.. note::

   Use a class-only protocol when the behavior defined by that protocol's requirements
   assumes or requires that a conforming type has
   reference semantics rather than value semantics.
   For more on reference and value semantics,
   see :ref:`ClassesAndStructures_StructuresAndEnumerationsAreValueTypes`
   and :ref:`ClassesAndStructures_ClassesAreReferenceTypes`.

.. assertion:: classMustAppearFirstInTheInheritanceList

   -> protocol P1 {}
   -> protocol P2: class, P1 {}
   -> protocol P3: P1, class {}
   !! <REPL Input>:1:18: error: 'class' must come first in the requirement list
   !! protocol P3: P1, class {}
   !! ~~^~~~~
   !! class,

.. TODO: a Cacheable protocol might make a good example here?

.. _Protocols_ProtocolComposition:

Protocol Composition
--------------------

It can be useful to require a type to conform to multiple protocols at once.
You can combine multiple protocols into a single requirement
with a :newTerm:`protocol composition`.
Protocol compositions have the form ``protocol<SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol>``.
You can list as many protocols within the pair of angle brackets (``<>``) as you need,
separated by commas.

Here's an example that combines two protocols called ``Named`` and ``Aged``
into a single protocol composition requirement on a function parameter:

.. testcode:: protocolComposition

   -> protocol Named {
         var name: String { get }
      }
   -> protocol Aged {
         var age: Int { get }
      }
   -> struct Person: Named, Aged {
         var name: String
         var age: Int
      }
   -> func wishHappyBirthday(celebrator: protocol<Named, Aged>) {
         println("Happy birthday \(celebrator.name) - you're \(celebrator.age)!")
      }
   -> let birthdayPerson = Person(name: "Malcolm", age: 21)
   << // birthdayPerson : Person = REPL.Person
   -> wishHappyBirthday(birthdayPerson)
   <- Happy birthday Malcolm - you're 21!

This example defines a protocol called ``Named``,
with a single requirement for a gettable ``String`` property called ``name``.
It also defines a protocol called ``Aged``,
with a single requirement for a gettable ``Int`` property called ``age``.
Both of these protocols are adopted by a structure called ``Person``.

The example also defines a function called ``wishHappyBirthday``,
which takes a single parameter called ``celebrator``.
The type of this parameter is ``protocol<Named, Aged>``,
which means “any type that conforms to both the ``Named`` and ``Aged`` protocols.”
It doesn't matter what specific type is passed to the function,
as long as it conforms to both of the required protocols.

The example then creates a new ``Person`` instance called ``birthdayPerson``
and passes this new instance to the ``wishHappyBirthday`` function.
Because ``Person`` conforms to both protocols, this is a valid call,
and the ``wishHappyBirthday`` function is able to print its birthday greeting.

.. note::

   Protocol compositions do not define a new, permanent protocol type.
   Rather, they define a temporary local protocol that has the combined requirements
   of all protocols in the composition.

.. _Protocols_CheckingForProtocolConformance:

Checking for Protocol Conformance
---------------------------------

You can use the ``is`` and ``as`` operators described in :doc:`TypeCasting`
to check for protocol conformance, and to cast to a specific protocol.
Checking for and casting to a protocol
follows exactly the same syntax as checking for and casting to a type:

* The ``is`` operator returns ``true`` if an instance conforms to a protocol
  and returns ``false`` if it does not.
* The ``as?`` version of the downcast operator returns
  an optional value of the protocol's type,
  and this value is ``nil`` if the instance does not conform to that protocol.
* The ``as!`` version of the downcast operator forces the downcast to the protocol type
  and triggers a runtime error if the downcast does not succeed.

This example defines a protocol called ``HasArea``,
with a single property requirement of a gettable ``Double`` property called ``area``:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> protocol HasArea {
         var area: Double { get }
      }

Here are two classes, ``Circle`` and ``Country``,
both of which conform to the ``HasArea`` protocol:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> class Circle: HasArea {
         let pi = 3.1415927
         var radius: Double
         var area: Double { return pi * radius * radius }
         init(radius: Double) { self.radius = radius }
      }
   -> class Country: HasArea {
         var area: Double
         init(area: Double) { self.area = area }
      }

The ``Circle`` class implements the ``area`` property requirement
as a computed property, based on a stored ``radius`` property.
The ``Country`` class implements the ``area`` requirement directly as a stored property.
Both classes correctly conform to the ``HasArea`` protocol.

Here's a class called ``Animal``, which does not conform to the ``HasArea`` protocol:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> class Animal {
         var legs: Int
         init(legs: Int) { self.legs = legs }
      }

The ``Circle``, ``Country`` and ``Animal`` classes do not have a shared base class.
Nonetheless, they are all classes, and so instances of all three types
can be used to initialize an array that stores values of type ``AnyObject``:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> let objects: [AnyObject] = [
         Circle(radius: 2.0),
         Country(area: 243_610),
         Animal(legs: 4)
      ]
   << // objects : [AnyObject] = [REPL.Circle, REPL.Country, REPL.Animal]

The ``objects`` array is initialized with an array literal containing
a ``Circle`` instance with a radius of 2 units;
a ``Country`` instance initialized with
the surface area of the United Kingdom in square kilometers;
and an ``Animal`` instance with four legs.

The ``objects`` array can now be iterated,
and each object in the array can be checked to see if
it conforms to the ``HasArea`` protocol:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> for object in objects {
         if let objectWithArea = object as? HasArea {
            println("Area is \(objectWithArea.area)")
         } else {
            println("Something that doesn't have an area")
         }
      }
   </ Area is 12.5663708
   </ Area is 243610.0
   </ Something that doesn't have an area

Whenever an object in the array conforms to the ``HasArea`` protocol,
the optional value returned by the ``as?`` operator is unwrapped with optional binding
into a constant called ``objectWithArea``.
The ``objectWithArea`` constant is known to be of type ``HasArea``,
and so its ``area`` property can be accessed and printed in a type-safe way.

Note that the underlying objects are not changed by the casting process.
They continue to be a ``Circle``, a ``Country`` and an ``Animal``.
However, at the point that they are stored in the ``objectWithArea`` constant,
they are only known to be of type ``HasArea``,
and so only their ``area`` property can be accessed.

.. TODO: This is an *extremely* contrived example.
   Also, it's not particularly useful to be able to get the area of these two objects,
   because there's no shared unit system.
   Also also, I'd say that a circle should probably be a structure, not a class.
   Plus, I'm having to write lots of boilerplate initializers,
   which make the example far less focused than I'd like.
   The problem is, I can't use strings within an @objc protocol
   without also having to import Foundation, so it's numbers or bust, I'm afraid.

.. TODO: Since the restrictions on @objc of the previous TODO are now lifted,
   Should the previous examples be revisited?

.. _Protocols_OptionalProtocolRequirements:

Optional Protocol Requirements
------------------------------

.. TODO: split this section into several subsections as per [Contributor 7746]'s feedback,
   and cover the missing alternative approaches that he mentioned.

.. TODO: you can specify optional subscripts,
   and the way you check for them / work with them is a bit esoteric.
   You have to try and access a value from the subscript,
   and see if the value you get back (which will be an optional)
   has a value or is nil.

You can define :newTerm:`optional requirements` for protocols,
These requirements do not have to be implemented by types that conform to the protocol.
Optional requirements are prefixed by the ``optional`` modifier
as part of the protocol's definition.

An optional protocol requirement can be called with optional chaining,
to account for the possibility that the requirement was not implemented
by a type that conforms to the protocol.
For information on optional chaining, see :doc:`OptionalChaining`.

You check for an implementation of an optional requirement
by writing a question mark after the name of the requirement when it is called,
such as ``someOptionalMethod?(someArgument)``.
Optional property requirements, and optional method requirements that return a value,
will always return an optional value of the appropriate type when they are accessed or called,
to reflect the fact that the optional requirement may not have been implemented.

.. note::

   Optional protocol requirements can only be specified
   if your protocol is marked with the ``@objc`` attribute.

   This attribute indicates that
   the protocol should be exposed to Objective-C code and is described in
   `Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C <//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216>`_.
   Even if you are not interoperating with Objective-C,
   you need to mark your protocols with the ``@objc`` attribute
   if you want to specify optional requirements.

   Note also that ``@objc`` protocols can be adopted only by classes,
   and not by structures or enumerations.
   If you mark your protocol as ``@objc`` in order to specify optional requirements,
   you will only be able to apply that protocol to class types.

.. QUESTION: is this acceptable wording for this limitation?

.. TODO: remove this note when this limitation is lifted in the future.

The following example defines an integer-counting class called ``Counter``,
which uses an external data source to provide its increment amount.
This data source is defined by the ``CounterDataSource`` protocol,
which has two optional requirements:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> @objc protocol CounterDataSource {
         optional func incrementForCount(count: Int) -> Int
         optional var fixedIncrement: Int { get }
      }

The ``CounterDataSource`` protocol defines
an optional method requirement called ``incrementForCount``
and an optional property requirement called ``fixedIncrement``.
These requirements define two different ways for data sources to provide
an appropriate increment amount for a ``Counter`` instance.

.. note::

   Strictly speaking, you can write a custom class
   that conforms to ``CounterDataSource`` without implementing
   *either* protocol requirement.
   They are both optional, after all.
   Although technically allowed, this wouldn't make for a very good data source.

The ``Counter`` class, defined below,
has an optional ``dataSource`` property of type ``CounterDataSource?``:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> @objc class Counter {
         var count = 0
         var dataSource: CounterDataSource?
         func increment() {
            if let amount = dataSource?.incrementForCount?(count) {
               count += amount
            } else if let amount = dataSource?.fixedIncrement {
               count += amount
            }
         }
      }

The ``Counter`` class stores its current value in a variable property called ``count``.
The ``Counter`` class also defines a method called ``increment``,
which increments the ``count`` property every time the method is called.

The ``increment()`` method first tries to retrieve an increment amount
by looking for an implementation of the ``incrementForCount(_:)`` method on its data source.
The ``increment()`` method uses optional chaining to try to call ``incrementForCount(_:)``,
and passes the current ``count`` value as the method's single argument.

Note *two* levels of optional chaining at play here.
Firstly, it is possible that ``dataSource`` may be ``nil``,
and so ``dataSource`` has a question mark after its name to indicate that
``incrementForCount`` should only be called if ``dataSource`` is non-nil.
Secondly, even if ``dataSource`` *does* exist,
there is no guarantee that it implements ``incrementForCount``,
because it is an optional requirement.
This is why ``incrementForCount`` is also written with a question mark after its name.

Because the call to ``incrementForCount`` can fail for either of these two reasons,
the call returns an *optional* ``Int`` value.
This is true even though ``incrementForCount`` is defined as returning
a non-optional ``Int`` value in the definition of ``CounterDataSource``.

.. TODO: explain why there is only one layer of optional here,
   even though there are two points of failure.
   (This was technical review feedback from [Contributor 6004].)

After calling ``incrementForCount``, the optional ``Int`` that it returns
is unwrapped into a constant called ``amount``, using optional binding.
If the optional ``Int`` does contain a value ---
that is, if the delegate and method both exist,
and the method returned a value ---
the unwrapped ``amount`` is added onto the stored ``count`` property,
and incrementation is complete.

If it is *not* possible to retrieve a value from the ``incrementForCount(_:)`` method ---
either because ``dataSource`` is nil,
or because the data source does not implement ``incrementForCount`` ---
then the ``increment()`` method tries to retrieve a value
from the data source's ``fixedIncrement`` property instead.
The ``fixedIncrement`` property is also an optional requirement,
and so its name is also written using optional chaining with a question mark on the end,
to indicate that the attempt to access the property's value can fail.
As before, the returned value is an optional ``Int`` value,
even though ``fixedIncrement`` is defined as a non-optional ``Int`` property
as part of the ``CounterDataSource`` protocol definition.

Here's a simple ``CounterDataSource`` implementation where the data source
returns a constant value of ``3`` every time it is queried.
It does this by implementing the optional ``fixedIncrement`` property requirement:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> class ThreeSource: CounterDataSource {
         let fixedIncrement = 3
      }

You can use an instance of ``ThreeSource`` as the data source for a new ``Counter`` instance:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> var counter = Counter()
   << // counter : Counter = REPL.Counter
   -> counter.dataSource = ThreeSource()
   -> for _ in 1...4 {
         counter.increment()
         println(counter.count)
      }
   </ 3
   </ 6
   </ 9
   </ 12

The code above creates a new ``Counter`` instance;
sets its data source to be a new ``ThreeSource`` instance;
and calls the counter's ``increment()`` method four times.
As expected, the counter's ``count`` property increases by three
each time ``increment()`` is called.

Here's a more complex data source called ``TowardsZeroSource``,
which makes a ``Counter`` instance count up or down towards zero
from its current ``count`` value:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> class TowardsZeroSource: CounterDataSource {
         func incrementForCount(count: Int) -> Int {
            if count == 0 {
               return 0
            } else if count < 0 {
               return 1
            } else {
               return -1
            }
         }
      }

The ``TowardsZeroSource`` class implements
the optional ``incrementForCount(_:)`` method from the ``CounterDataSource`` protocol
and uses the ``count`` argument value to work out which direction to count in.
If ``count`` is already zero, the method returns ``0``
to indicate that no further counting should take place.

You can use an instance of ``TowardsZeroSource`` with the existing ``Counter`` instance
to count from ``-4`` to zero.
Once the counter reaches zero, no more counting takes place:

.. testcode:: protocolConformance

   -> counter.count = -4
   -> counter.dataSource = TowardsZeroSource()
   -> for _ in 1...5 {
         counter.increment()
         println(counter.count)
      }
   </ -3
   </ -2
   </ -1
   </ 0
   </ 0
