Classes
=======

:newTerm:`Classes` in Swift have a lot in common with structures.
They can have properties, methods, subscripts, initializers, and so on.
Just like with structures,
you use dot syntax to access properties and methods
of class instances.
However, there are a few important differences:

* Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another,
  as described in :doc:`Inheritance`.
* Deinitializers enable an instance of a class
  to free up any resources it has allocated,
  as described in :doc:`Deinitialization`.
* You can have more than one reference to a class instance,
  as described in :doc:`AutomaticReferenceCounting`.

.. XXX ARC is more about sharing and identity

.. The paragraph below appears verbatim in both Classes and Structures.

Swift provides both classes and structures,
but most of the time your code uses structures.
For more details about choosing between them,
see :doc:`ReferenceAndValueTypes`.

.. XXX Restore and reword the terminology note about "object" versus "instance".

   .. note::

   An instance of a class is traditionally known as an object.
   However, Swift classes and structures
   are much closer in functionality than in other languages,
   and much of this chapter describes functionality
   that can apply to instances of either a class or a structure type.
   Because of this, the more general term instance is used.

.. _Classes_ClassSyntax:

Class Syntax
------------

You introduce a class with the ``class`` keyword and place its definition
within a pair of braces:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> class SomeClass {
           // class definition goes here
       }

Here is an example of a class definition:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> class Window {
           var width: Int
           var height: Int
           
           init(width: Int, height: Int) {
               self.width = width
               self.height = height
           }
       }

The example above defines a new class called ``Window`` 
to describe a graphical window.
This class has two variable stored properties called ``width`` and ``height``.
Because there is no natural default for a window's width and height,
these two properties are explicitly defined to be of type ``Int``
and are set to the integer values passed in to the initializer.

As with structures,
the simplest form of initializer syntax for classes
uses the type name of the class
followed by empty parentheses:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> let someInstance = SomeClass()
    << // someInstance : SomeClass = REPL.SomeClass

However, you can use this initializer syntax
only if you set all of the stored properties in your class
to initial values in the class definition.

Unlike structures,
classes do not have a default memberwise initializer.
Instead, you define custom initializers
that provide the initialization logic you need.
Because the two stored properties belonging to ``Window``
are not set to initial values by default,
``Window`` needs a custom initializer.
To initialize a class like ``Window`` with a custom initializer,
use the type name of the class
followed by any parameters needed
for initialization in parentheses:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> let someWindow = Window(width: 500, height: 300)
    << // someWindow : Window = REPL.Window

This creates a new instance of the ``Window`` class
and initializes its ``width`` to ``500`` and ``height`` to 300.

For more information on class initialization, see :doc:`Initialization`.

.. _Classes_ClassesAreReferenceTypes:

Classes Are Reference Types
---------------------------

Classes have different behavior from structures
because they are reference types ---
not value types.
A :newTerm:`reference type` is a type
whose instance is referenced rather than copied
when it is assigned to a variable or constant,
or when it is passed to a function.

Imagine an application that can have multiple windows open and
needs to keep track of the currently selected window.
Suppose there are two windows to keep track of:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> let windowOne = Window(width: 500, height: 300)
    << // windowOne : Window = REPL.Window
    -> let windowTwo = Window(width: 400, height: 400)
    << // windowTwo : Window = REPL.Window

Next, a new variable called ``currentWindow``
is declared and set equal to ``windowOne``:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> var currentWindow = windowOne
    << // currentWindow : Window = REPL.Window
    -> currentWindow.width = 800

Because classes are reference types,
``windowOne`` and ``currentWindow``
both refer to the *same* ``Window`` instance.
Another way of thinking about it is that
``windowOne`` and ``currentWindow`` are
two different names for the same instance.
As a result, changing the width of ``currentWindow``
changes the width of ``windowOne``.

Checking the ``width`` property of ``windowOne``
confirms that it changed to ``800``:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> print("The width of windowOne is now \(windowOne.width)")
    <- The width of windowOne is now 800

.. _Classes_ComparingReferenceTypesForIdentity:

Comparing Reference Types for Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because classes are reference types,
it is possible for multiple constants and variables
to refer to the same instance of a class.

As mentioned in :ref:`BasicOperators_ComparisonOperators`,
Swift provides two identity operators (``===`` and ``!==``)
that allow you to check
if two constants or variables
refer to the same instance of a class.

Here is an example
that uses the ``windowOne`` and ``currentWindow`` instances from above
to show an identity operator in use:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> if currentWindow === windowOne {
           print("windowOne and currentWindow refer to the same Window instance")
       }
    <- windowOne and currentWindow refer to the same Window instance

.. note:: 

   “Identical to” (represented by three equals signs, or ``===``)
   does not mean the same thing
   as “equal to” (represented by two equals signs, or ``==``).
   “Identical to” means that two constants or variables of class type
   refer to exactly the same class instance.
   “Equal to” means that two instances
   are considered “equal” or “equivalent” in value,
   for some appropriate meaning of “equal”,
   as defined by the type's designer.

.. _Classes_ConstantsAndReferenceTypes:

Constants and Reference Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the fundamental characteristics of reference semantics
is that a single instance can be referred to in multiple places.
In the example above,
you may have noticed that ``windowOne`` is declared as a *constant*,
rather than a variable.
However, you can still change the variable properties of ``windowOne``
such as ``windowOne.width``.
This is because the value of the ``windowOne`` constant itself
does not store the ``Window`` instance ---
it *refers* to a ``Window`` instance.
It is the ``width`` property of the underlying ``Window`` that is changed ---
not the value of the constant reference to that ``Window``.

.. XXX maybe put more emphasis on shared mutable state

Consider the following example: 

.. testcode:: classes

    -> class ExampleClass {
           let constant = 5
           var variable = 8
       }
    
    -> let classInstance = ExampleClass()
    << // classInstance : ExampleClass = REPL.ExampleClass
    -> classInstance.constant = 10 // Error
    !! <REPL Input>:1:24: error: cannot assign to property: 'constant' is a 'let' constant
    !! classInstance.constant = 10 // Error
    !! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^
    !! <REPL Input>:2:7: note: change 'let' to 'var' to make it mutable
    !! let constant = 5
    !! ^~~
    !! var
    -> classInstance.variable = 16
    -> classInstance = Window()    // Error
    !! <REPL Input>:1:15: error: cannot assign to value: 'classInstance' is a 'let' constant
    !! classInstance = Window()    // Error
    !! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^
    !! <REPL Input>:1:1: note: change 'let' to 'var' to make it mutable
    !! let classInstance = ExampleClass()
    !! ^~~
    !! var

Because ``classInstance`` is a class instance,
it refers to an ``ExampleClass`` instance
rather than storing it.
As a result,
it is valid to mutate the ``variable`` property
and invalid to mutate the ``constant`` property
of ``classInstance``.
Additionally,
you cannot reassign ``classInstance`` to a different class instance
because it's a constant reference.
This feature of being able to change
the underlying variable properties of the same instance
is something unique you get when working with classes.
In contrast,
changing the variable properties of a structure instance
gives you a whole new structure instance
instead of the same instance modified in place.

.. XXX the "because it's a constant reference"
   comes pretty late in this sentence - reword?

.. XXX Above fact about getting a whole new structure is probably wrong.

.. note:: 

   If you have experience with C, C++, or Objective-C,
   you may know that these languages use pointers
   to refer to addresses in memory.
   A Swift constant or variable
   that refers to an instance of some reference type
   is similar to a pointer in C,
   but is not a direct pointer to an address in memory,
   and does not require you to write an asterisk (``*``)
   to indicate that you are creating a reference.
   Instead, these references are defined
   like any other Swift constant or variable.

.. XXX maybe bring back the xref to stdlib pointer stuff
