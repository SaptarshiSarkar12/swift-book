Classes
=======

:newTerm:`Classes` in Swift can do all that structures can do and more.

Like structures, classes can:

* Define properties to store values
* Define methods to provide functionality
* Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
* Define initializers to set up their initial state
* Be extended to provide added functionality
* Conform to protocols to implement a shared abstraction or cooperate with a default implementation

For more information, see
:doc:`Properties`, :doc:`Methods`, :doc:`Subscripts`, :doc:`Initialization`,
:doc:`Extensions`, and :doc:`Protocols`.

Unlike structures, classes can:

* Inherit the characteristics of another class
* Have their instances type checked and interpreted at runtime through type casting
* Free up assigned resources using a deinitializer
* Have more than one reference to a class instance through reference counting

For more information, see
:doc:`Inheritance`,
:doc:`TypeCasting`,
:doc:`Deinitialization`,
and :doc:`AutomaticReferenceCounting`.

For an in-depth discussion of
when to use classes and
when to use structures,
see :doc:`ChoosingBetweenClassesAndStructures`.

.. _Classes_ClassSyntax:

Class Syntax
------------

You introduce a class with the ``class`` keyword and place its definition
within a pair of braces:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> class SomeClass {
           // class definition goes here
       }

Here is an example of a class definition:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> class Window {
           var width = 0
           var height = 0
       }

The example above defines a new class called ``Window`` 
to describe a graphical window.
This class has two variable stored properties
called ``width`` and ``height``.
These two properties are inferred to be of type ``Int``
by setting them to an initial integer value of ``0``.

The ``Window`` class describes only
what a ``Window`` instance will look like.
It does not describe a specific ``Window`` instance.
To do that, you create an instance of the class.

The simplest form of initialization syntax for classes
uses the type name of the class
followed by empty parentheses:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> let someWindow = Window()
    << // someWindow : Window = REPL.Window

This creates a new instance of the ``Window`` class
and initializes its properties to their default values.

Class initialization is covered in more detail in :doc:`Initialization`.

.. _Classes_AccessingPropertiesOfClasses:

Accessing Properties of Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access the properties
of a class instance
using dot syntax:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> print("The width of the window is \(someWindow.width)")
    <- The width of the window is 0
    -> print("The height of the window is \(someWindow.height)")
    <- The height of the window is 0

In this example,
``someWindow.width`` and ``someWindow.height``
refer to the ``width`` and ``height`` properties 
of ``someWindow``,
and return their default initial value of ``0``.

As with structures,
you use dot syntax
to assign a new value
to a variable property:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> someWindow.width = 1024
    -> print("The width of the window is now \(someWindow.width)")
    <- The width of the window is now 1024


.. _Classes_ClassesAreReferenceTypes:

Classes Are Reference Types
---------------------------

A :newTerm:`reference type` is a type
whose instance is referenced rather than copied
when it is assigned
to a variable or constant,
or when it is passed
to a function.

Consider this example:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> let rootWindow = Window()
    << // rootWindow : Window = REPL.Window
    -> rootWindow.width = 1024

This example sets the ``width`` property
of ``rootWindow`` to ``1024``.

Next, a new variable called ``currentWindow`` is assigned ``rootWindow``:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> var currentWindow = rootWindow
    << // currentWindow : Window = REPL.Window
    -> currentWindow.width = 800

Because classes are reference types,
``rootWindow`` and ``currentWindow``
actually both refer to the *same* ``Window`` instance.
As a result, changing the width of ``currentWindow``
changes the width of ``rootWindow``.
``rootWindow`` and ``currentWindow`` are effectively
two different names for the same single instance.

Checking the ``width`` property of ``rootWindow``
confirms that it changed to `800`:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> print("The width of rootWindow is now \(rootWindow.width)")
    <- The width of rootWindow is now 800

.. note:: 
   ``rootWindow`` is declared as a *constant*,
   rather than a variable.
   However, you can still change
   the properties of ``rootWindow``
   such as ``rootWindow.width``.
   This is because the value
   of the ``rootWindow`` constant itself
   does not "store" the ``Window`` instance ---
   it *refers* to a ``Window`` instance.
   It is the ``width`` property
   of the underlying ``Window`` that is changed ---
   not the value of the constant reference to that ``Window``.

.. _Classes_ComparingReferenceTypesForIdentity:

Comparing Reference Types For Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because classes are reference types,
it is possible for multiple constants and variables
to refer to the same single instance of a class
behind the scenes.

As mentioned in :ref:`BasicOperators_ComparisonOperators`,
Swift provides two identity operators (``===`` and ``!==``)
that allow you to check
if two constants or variables
refer to the exact same instance of a class.

Here is an example
that uses the ``rootWindow`` and ``currentWindow`` instances from above
to show an identity operator in use:

.. testcode:: classes

    -> if currentWindow === rootWindow {
           print("rootWindow and currentWindow refer to the same Window instance")
       }
    <- rootWindow and currentWindow refer to the same Window instance

.. _Classes_WorkingWithPointers:

Working With Pointers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have experience with C, C++, or Objective-C,
you may know that these languages use :newTerm:`pointers`
to refer to addresses in memory.
A Swift constant or variable
that refers to an instance of some reference type
is similar to a pointer in C,
but is not a direct pointer to an address in memory,
and does not require you to write an asterisk (``*``)
to indicate that you are creating a reference.
Instead, these references are defined
like any other Swift constant or variable.

.. TODO: Add a brief comment on why this protection is a good thing

.. note:: 

    Swiftâ€™s Standard Library provides utility types
    that enable you to work with memory pointers
    to Swift reference types for interoperability
    with low-level C code.
    For more information,
    see [name of appropriate Swift type or types]
    in the Swift Standard Library Reference.
