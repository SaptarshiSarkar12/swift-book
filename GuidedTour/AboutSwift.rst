About Swift
===========

Swift is a safe, fast, and interactive programming language
that combines the best in modern language thinking
with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture
and the diverse contributions from its open-source community.
The compiler is optimized for performance,
and the language is optimized for development,
without compromising on either.

.. Does the paragraph below still need to exist?
   (I'm guessing not.)
   It describes the history of how Swift came to be
   through various improvements to Objective-C
   which programmers starting out today likely take for granted.

Swift is a fantastic way to write iOS, OS X, and watchOS apps.
Apple laid the foundation for Swift
by advancing our existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure.
We simplified memory management with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).
Our framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa,
has been modernized and standardized throughout.
Objective-C itself has evolved
to support blocks, collection literals, nullability annotations, generics, and modules.
Building from this common ground,
Swift provides seamless access to existing Cocoa frameworks
and mix-and-match interoperability with Objective-C code.

.. Need a different word than "safe" in the paragraph below.
   In a technical/Swift context, "safe" means "memory safe" --
   that is, the opposite of permitting/causing memory corruption.

.. I'm not sure exactly what "optimized native code" is meant to mean below,
   but I think the intent was to point out that Swift isn't interpreted
   and doesn't use some sort of high-level, JVM-like bytecode.

Swift is an industrial-quality systems programming language.
By adopting safe programming patterns,
Swift eliminates entire classes of unsafe code:
Variables are always initialized before use,
arrays indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors,
integers are checked for overflow,
optionals ensure that `nil` values are handled explicitly,
memory is managed automatically,
and error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.
Swift is also built to be fast.
Swift code is transformed into optimized native code that gets the most out of modern hardware.
The syntax and standard library have also been tuned
based on the guiding principle that
the obvious way to write your code should also perform the best.
Combining safety and speed, Swift is an excellent choice for
everything from "Hello, world!" to an entire operating system.

Swift is friendly to new programmers.
It's the first compiled language
that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.
It supports playgrounds, an innovative feature
that allows you to experiment with Swift code and see the results immediately,
without the overhead of building and running an app.
Combining powerful type inference and pattern matching with
a modern, lightweight syntax
Swift allows complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner.
As a result, code is not just easier to write,
but easier to read and maintain as well.

Swift has been years in the making,
and it will continue to evolve with new features and capabilities
for many years to come.
Our goals for Swift are ambitious.
We canâ€™t wait to see what you create with it.
